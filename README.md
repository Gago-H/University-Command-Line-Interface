# University-Command-Line-Interface
Allows you to access an existing list of information for a University.
You are given a list of commands to use at your disposal to change the list in anyway you would like.
Commands: "hire", "admit", "find student", "find faculty", "list students", "list faculty", "quit" (case sensitive).
Serialization is implemented in this project so you information is saved after using the "quit" command.
All files need to be in the same project when running UniversityDriver.java.
